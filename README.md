## INSTALL CREDITS NODE

## Setting up account

To attach your existing account to node you need to create pair of two files:

- ~/.credits/NodePublic.txt - your public key
- ~/.credits/NodePrivate.txt - your private key

After that restart node container if it's already running:

```
docker restart csnode
```
